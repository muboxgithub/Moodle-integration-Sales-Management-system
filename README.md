# Project Overview
I have designed and implemented a project for the Etemari website, utilizing the Moodle open-source platform to manage sales. This involved creating a new dashboard specifically for sales management.

# Features
The system generates unique links for agents, granting them access to their personalized pages. Through authentication, agents can view the number of registered students, payments received, and outstanding payments. A weekly graph provides a visual representation of this data. Additionally, when users or students register using the generated link, the agent code input field is automatically populated.

# Marketing Enhancement
This project significantly boosts the marketing efforts of the Etemari website by facilitating sales across various schools. Agents earn commissions when students make payments through their assigned links.
